# About
AGREE Press is an independent publisher of narrative nonfiction, memoir, and investigative journalism with team members located around the world. We believe in a collaborative process, allowing our writers more creative control over their works. We've also streamlined the editorial process, bringing books to market faster and with lower costs than the old-school publishers without compromising quality.

## Submissions
Please email your query letter to contact@agreepress.com with the word QUERY and the title of your project in the subject line. Your letter should include a concise description of your book (no more than three paragraphs), along with information about your platform as an author and any unique marketing opportunities. You may include one chapter (ideally the first). Please allow four weeks for a response. It may take some time to weigh our interest, research the market, and write up our questions, but we value every writer's time, so we try to reply as soon as possible.
